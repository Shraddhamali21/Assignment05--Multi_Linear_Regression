1. 50 START-UPS DATASET

As part of an in-depth data science project, I focused on developing a robust prediction model for estimating the profit of startups using multi-linear regression analysis. The project involved extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation techniques to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of the predictive model. Here's a brief overview of the project:
 
Problem Statement:
 
The primary objective of the project was to prepare a predictive model capable of forecasting the profit of startups based on various input features. Specifically, the project utilized a dataset named "50_startups data," encompassing information on research and development spend, administration spend, marketing spend, and the state from which data is collected, along with the corresponding profit figures for each state.
 
Approach:
 
The project adopted a systematic approach, beginning with comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the distributions, correlations, and potential relationships between the features and the target variable (profit). Subsequently, various transformations and feature engineering techniques were applied to optimize the predictive model's performance and interpretability.
 
Key steps involved in the project include:
 
1. Data Preprocessing:
 - Handling missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
 - Encoding categorical variables (such as the state feature) using techniques like one-hot encoding.
 
2. Feature Engineering:
 - Creation of new features or transformations to capture non-linear relationships.
 - Scaling or normalization of features to ensure comparable scales for regression analysis.
 
3. Model Building:
 - Utilizing multi-linear regression analysis to develop prediction models.
 - Training the models on the processed dataset, using techniques like cross-validation for robust evaluation.
 
4. Model Evaluation:
 - Assessing the performance of the models using metrics such as R-squared (R^2) value, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and others.
 - Comparison of multiple models to identify the most effective one in terms of predictive accuracy and interpretability.
 
5. Table Creation:
 - Compiling a table containing the R-squared (R^2) values for each prepared model, providing a clear summary of model performance and effectiveness.
 
By systematically implementing these steps and leveraging Python programming language along with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn, the project aimed to deliver actionable insights and predictive capabilities to support strategic decision-making for startups. The project not only honed my skills in multi-linear regression analysis but also underscored the importance of data-driven approaches in driving business success.



2. TOYOTA COROLLA DATASET

Problem Statement:
 
The primary goal of the project was to prepare a predictive model capable of forecasting the price of cars using a subset of relevant features. Specifically, the project considered only a subset of columns from the dataset, including attributes such as age of the car, mileage, horsepower, engine volume, number of doors, gear positions, quarterly tax, and weight, among others. The target variable for prediction was the price of the car.
 
Dataset:
 
The dataset, named "Corolla," comprised a range of features related to car specifications and characteristics, along with the corresponding price of each car. The selected columns from the dataset included:
 
- Price: Offer Price in Euros
- Age_08_04: Age of the car in months as of August 2004
- KM: Accumulated kilometers on the odometer
- HP: Horsepower
- cc: Cylinder volume in cubic centimeters
- Doors: Number of doors
- Gears: Number of gear positions
- Quarterly_Tax: Quarterly road tax in Euros
- Weight: Weight of the car in kilograms
 
Approach:
 
The project followed a systematic approach to building the prediction model, encompassing several key steps:
 
1. Data Preprocessing:
 - Handling missing values, if any, and cleaning the dataset.
 - Performing feature scaling or normalization to ensure comparable scales for the features.
 - Encoding categorical variables, if present, using techniques like one-hot encoding.
 
2. Feature Selection:
 - Selecting a subset of relevant features from the dataset based on their potential influence on the target variable (price).
 - Considering features such as age, mileage, horsepower, and other specifications that are likely to impact the price of the car.
 
3. Model Building:
 - Utilizing multi-linear regression analysis to develop the prediction model.
 - Training the model on the processed dataset, using techniques like cross-validation for robust evaluation.
 
4. Model Evaluation:
 - Assessing the performance of the model using metrics such as R-squared (R^2) value, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and others.
 - Comparing the model's performance against baseline models and evaluating its predictive accuracy and generalization ability.
 
By systematically implementing these steps and leveraging Python programming language along with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn, the project aimed to deliver a reliable and accurate prediction model for estimating the price of cars based on their specifications.
